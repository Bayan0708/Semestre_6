# Semestre_6
In this folder I will upload my files made in my sixth semester of college
There are topics related to relativity, from which we can highlight my project that corresponds to the Chandrasekhar limit. 
Also some codes to explain my analytical mechanics tasks.
On the other hand, you will find codes for the MAF subject (advanced mathematics of physics), where my project was to make a code for the 3-body problem.
